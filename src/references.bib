abstract = {This paper provides an overview of commercially available model predictive control (MPC) technology, both linear and nonlinear, based primarily on data provided by MPC vendors. A brief history of industrial MPC technology is presented first, followed by results of our vendor survey of MPC control and identification technology. A general MPC control algorithm is presented, and approaches taken by each vendor for the different aspects of the calculation are described. Identification technology is reviewed to determine similarities and differences between the various approaches. MPC applications performed by each vendor are summarized by application area. The final section presents a vision of the next generation of MPC technology, with an emphasis on potential business and research opportunities.}
